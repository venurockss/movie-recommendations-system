# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Machine Learning** in Python. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences, leveraging techniques such as content-based filtering.

## 🚀 Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similarity in genres, cast, or plot.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity** for recommendations.
- **Dataset Used**: IMDb, TMDB, or MovieLens dataset.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Users can input their favorite movie name and receive recommendations in the terminal.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Difflib
- **Dataset Source**: TMDB / MovieLens / IMDb

## ⚡ Installation & Usage
### 🔹 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```
### 🔹 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 🔹 3. Run the Recommendation Script
```bash
python recommendation.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your favorite movie name and receive recommendations.

## 📊 How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user enters their favorite movie name.
2. **Finding Close Matches**: The system finds the closest matching movie title.
3. **Computing Similarity Scores**: The model computes similarity scores for other movies.
4. **Displaying Recommendations**: The system suggests the top similar movies.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
✅ Implement a Flask-based web interface for better user experience.
✅ Enhance recommendation accuracy with deep learning models.
✅ Allow users to filter recommendations by genre, year, or rating.
